# Ingestion pipeline runbook

Finds companies that use Workday, captures public buying signals with a source link, date and exact quote,
scores them with the shared rubric and writes everything to Supabase. No human clicks during a run.

## 1. Setup

```bash
npm ci
npx supabase start                    # local, isolated database (Docker). First start pulls images.
npx supabase db push --local          # apply new pipeline migrations to an existing local database
cp .env.example .env.pipeline.local   # then fill the PIPELINE_* values below (file is gitignored)
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b                # default local model
npm test && npm run test:integration
```

`.env.pipeline.local` for a local run:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PIPELINE_SUPABASE_URL` / `PIPELINE_SUPABASE_KEY` | Target database. Local: `http://127.0.0.1:54321` and the `SECRET_KEY` from `npx supabase status`. **Deliberately not `SUPABASE_URL`**: that points at production in `.env.local`. |
| `PIPELINE_ALLOW_REMOTE` | Only for an approved non-local *test* project: its project ref. Any other remote URL is refused. |
| `PIPELINE_LLM` | `ollama` (default) \| `openai` \| `gemini` \| `none`. |
| `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` | Local model (default `qwen2.5:7b`, context 6144). |
| `PIPELINE_ALLOW_PAID_LLM`, `PIPELINE_LLM_BUDGET_USD`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Paid models. Off unless `PIPELINE_ALLOW_PAID_LLM=1` **and** a budget > 0. Ask before enabling. |
| `TREG_TOKEN` | Existing treg credential. When empty, the signed-in `treg` CLI is used unless disabled. |
| `TREG_ORG` / `TREG_DISABLE_CLI` | Organization slug (our local setup uses `cube`); set `TREG_DISABLE_CLI=1` to prevent implicit CLI fallback. |
| `TREG_BUDGET_USD` | Session cap for paid treg calls (default 0.50). `--max-spend` lowers it per run, never raises it. |
| `PIPELINE_CONTACT` | Contact address in every collector User-Agent. SEC answers 403 without one. |
| `PIPELINE_SEC_FILE` | Optional local copy of `company_tickers.json`, used only when `PIPELINE_CONTACT` is empty. |

Secrets live only in environment variables, `.env.pipeline.local` and GitHub secrets. Nothing prints them.

## 2. Run it

```bash
npm run pipeline -- run --plan weekly --limit 20            # discovery: SEC -> resolver -> extract -> match -> score
npm run pipeline -- run --plan daily --limit 20             # jobs -> extract (model) -> match -> score -> enrich
npm run pipeline -- run --plan all --limit 20 --max-spend 0.05
npm run pipeline -- run --plan collect --source workday-career-sites --limit 5
npm run pipeline -- run --plan extract | match | score | rescore | enrich
npm run pipeline -- run --plan weekly --dry-run             # in-memory: reads nothing from and writes nothing to the database
npm run pipeline -- import path/to/rows.csv                 # Import button rows
npm run pipeline -- health
npm run pipeline -- review list | approve <id> --domain x.com | merge <id> <company_id> | reject <id>
```

`--limit` is items per source (for the resolver: Workday sites to find; it tries up to six names per site).
`--no-llm` and `--no-treg` switch those off for one run.

Discovery selects unattempted company names in SEC list order. Attempt history is checked in
pages of up to 200 names until the requested batch is filled or the list is exhausted, so later
runs advance beyond previously probed names even deep into the list.

The resolver interleaves new names with due rechecks. Successful discoveries become eligible
after **7 days**, completed misses after **30 days**. Known-site refresh takes priority over
miss retries; within each group the oldest attempt goes first. These are eligibility intervals:
actual execution depends on the schedule and request/item limits. At scale, allocate enough
capacity to revisit known sites before their 14-day evidence lifetime ends. Rechecks count toward
the resolver's existing limit, so not every returned site will be newly discovered.

Known hosts are checked directly before tenant guesses. Unchanged robots captures refresh the
existing signals' `last_seen_at` without duplicating them. Failed or vanished sites do not renew
evidence. Network/server failures and searches cut short by the request cap do not become
completed misses or reset an existing retry clock; they remain eligible on the next run. The
existing HTTP retry/backoff and source-stop rules still apply. Dry runs do not save attempt times.
This uses the existing `found` / `tried_at` columns; no database migration is required.

## Website confirmation and review recovery

Apply `202610250001_website_confirmation.sql` to the local database before running this version.
The migration adds `website_resolutions` with service-role-only access and an atomic review-admission
RPC. Production rollout is a separate step: the Supabase integration may deploy migrations merged to main.

Treg's free `hunter.x.domain-finder` supplies up to three candidates. Both maximum route cost and waterfall
are set to zero, and successful HTTP/CLI responses must explicitly report a zero charge. There is no paid
website-lookup fallback. This path does not use the contact-enrichment budget or an LLM.

A website is confirmed only when:

1. Its provider name exactly matches the normalized candidate name (legal suffixes are ignored).
2. Its homepage identifies that same company in its title, site-name metadata or structured Organization data.
3. Its homepage, or one directly linked same-host careers page, links to an observed enabled Workday **tenant and site**.
4. All corroborating candidates resolve to one canonical hostname. Conflicts or unreadable competing candidates stay unresolved.

HTTPS redirects are limited and checked individually; robots rules apply at each destination. Fetches have
time/size/request limits and reject IP/private-network targets. No browser rendering or access-control bypass
is attempted. A homepage's HTTP 200, matching name alone or arbitrary body mention is insufficient.
Aliases that redirect to the same verified hostname collapse together. A parent/subdomain relationship to an
existing company goes to human review rather than creating another company or guessing a root domain.

`website_resolutions` retains candidate domains/names, identity text, proof-page and Workday URLs,
reasons, timestamps and the input signature. Confirmations are reusable for 30 days; unresolved results
retry after 7 days; transport/check errors retry after 1 day. A changed set of observed Workday sites
invalidates the cache immediately. These intervals differ from the Workday discovery retry intervals above.
At most 50 due candidates are evaluated per matching stage; website HTTP has a 300-request cap and the
stage stops starting candidates after five minutes. Deferred work stays queued. Each request has a ten-second
timeout; Treg lookup has a fifteen-second timeout. In-flight work may finish after the stage time threshold.

Matching revisits pending `no_website`, `untrusted_signal` and `over_run_cap` reviews even without new
unassigned signals. A fresh trusted signal, confirmed website, HTTPS evidence URL and room under the cap
allow creation. Existing confirmed domain matches attach to the existing company. Recovered admission locks
the pending review and creates/resolves/attaches in a single transaction; failure leaves it pending for retry.
New signals/sites join that review before admission. Rejected decisions remain rejected; `similar_name`
reviews remain human decisions. Cap-limited reviews can recover on the next run using cached confirmation.
Expired signals cannot unlock company creation until fresh evidence arrives.

Website/provider errors appear in matching stage errors and therefore the CLI failure signal. Provider
401/402/403/429 and nonzero/unknown charge responses stop further lookups for that stage. Other candidates
can continue after an individual website failure. Ordinary unresolved/ambiguous results remain review work.

This deliberately favors precision. Short brand aliases, JavaScript-only pages, redirects on robots.txt,
third-party careers portals, inaccessible pages and companies without an observable reciprocal link may
require manual review. A small live local batch must measure coverage before production or scheduling.
Other input sources can reuse the lookup; automatic confirmation currently requires an observed Workday site.

Inspect the evidence with:

```sql
select company_name, status, domain, reason, next_check_at, evidence
from website_resolutions order by checked_at desc;
```

## 3. Stages and rules

| Stage | What it does | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| Collect | `src/pipeline/collectors/*`, all `Collector.collect(source, limits, ctx) -> RawItem[]` | Plain HTTP/JSON, robots.txt checked, ≥1 s between requests to the same site, backoff on 429/503 (max 2 retries, Retry-After capped at 30 s). 401/403, CAPTCHA and "unavailable" pages (including 200 responses that are not the expected JSON) stop the source and are logged. |
| Raw store | `raw_captures` | Body exactly as received + SHA-256 fingerprint (volatile fields such as "Posted 3 Days Ago" excluded). Unchanged items are skipped and only refresh their signals' `last_seen_at`. Immutable (trigger). `pending_captures` is the work queue. |
| Extract | `src/pipeline/extract.ts` | Structured fields read directly (titles, dates, URLs, Workday tenant). The model reads only messy text into the fixed schema (`src/domain/ingestion/extraction-schema.ts`), temperature 0, JSON-schema constrained, retry once, then dead-letter. Quotes must be verbatim (else the signal is dropped); company, products, timing words, dates and project type must be supported by the text (else cleared and counted as hallucinations). Model down = captures stay queued. |
| Signals | `signals` | go_live, hiring, release_planning, known_customer, budget_clue, event; link, date, quote, confidence. Every type expires 14 days after last seen, except go-live (date bands). |
| Match | `src/domain/ingestion/matching.ts` | Confirmed exact website match merges. An unconfirmed website suggestion cannot assign signals to an existing company. Similar name -> review (`similar_name`, with suggestion). New company + confirmed website + trusted signal (≥0.9) -> created with `origin = pipeline` (atomic SQL function). Else review (`no_website`, `untrusted_signal`, `over_run_cap`). Workday itself is excluded. Size never blocks ("size unknown" when missing). |
| Score | `src/domain/ingestion/pipeline-score.ts` on the shared `buildAssessment` / `evaluateTier` | Only companies in scope (`scoring_scope = pipeline_only` -> pipeline companies only; matched existing companies only receive signals). No evidence = "Assessment status: unknown. Needs evidence: ..." (shown as Not Enough Evidence, never a silent 0). A row is appended when numbers, tier or sources change, and at least every 14 days. |
| Enrich | `src/pipeline/enrich.ts` | Only companies with Budget + Release + Timing ≥ `ready_for_contacts_threshold` (25). Free people search first; then one verified work-email lookup per contact within the treg cap. Never pays for LinkedIn; "valid" only = verified; risky stored unverified; invalid not stored; never guesses; same contact + step never paid twice. No budget -> `enrichment_requests.status = skipped_budget`, Authority/Reachability stay "Needs evidence", the run continues. |

Scoring = the **Mando team scoring rubric** (provisional revision of 2026-10-13), rubric version `mando-team-70:pipeline-v2`.
Weights 25/25/20/15/15; **Qualified 70+, Maybe 55+** for rows of this version (`tierThresholdsFor` in
`src/domain/scoring/rubric.ts`; rows of older versions keep 80/55). Code: `src/domain/ingestion/pipeline-score.ts`, tests:
`tests/ingestion/team-rubric.test.mjs`. How each rule maps onto what the pipeline collects:

| Category | Team rubric | What the pipeline can evidence automatically |
|---|---|---|
| Authority /25 | Role base 22/20/18/15/10/5/0; +3 employer 3,000+; +2 personal Workday responsibility; bonuses only for confirmed current contacts; best contact | Base from the title (`authorityBand`). Contacts found by the people search count as **current role unconfirmed** (5, no bonuses) until a person confirms them (`linkedin_status` confirmed/provided). +2 when the title names Workday. +3 only with a sourced employee count (company rows have none yet, so not awarded). |
| Reachability /25 | Email+phone 20, either 15, confirmed LinkedIn only 10, general inbox 5; +3 LinkedIn alongside, +3 dated initiative, +2 leading active Workday work, +5 willing introduction | Published (sourced) or provider-verified ("valid") work email; published direct phone (a live line alone does not count); LinkedIn only when confirmed. +5 only when `mutual_connection` records willingness; +2 is not collected. |
| Budget /20 | Operating-income capacity 10 (+1 +1) + one investment band 8/6/3; funded expansion 20; freeze 0 | Capacity is **not collected** (0, shown in the reason). Investment: dated budget clue within 24 months 8, undated/older 3, active Workday implementation 6. Labelled as a proxy. |
| Timing /15 | Strongest single trigger 15/12/10/8/5 | Go-live within the next 6 months 15, previous 6 months 12, 6-12 months 10; employer Workday hiring within 12 months 8; known customer, skill-only posting or undated go-live 5. |
| Release /15 | Confirmed deployment; 42-84 days before a confirmed release 12 (+3 documented preparation = 15), 85-126 days 10, otherwise 8 | Deployment = known customer, release planning or a past go-live. Bands use `releases.ts` confirmed dates; an estimated next release (2027R1 today) gives 8. |

Reasons are capped at 240 characters; every awarded point carries its link; unknowns say "Needs evidence" without a URL.

## 4. Read the run log and health

```sql
select job, source_id, trigger, status, counts, requests_made, llm_spend_usd, treg_spend_usd, error, started_at, finished_at
from pipeline_runs order by started_at desc limit 20;
select * from pipeline_health;   -- last run, new companies (7 days), review queue, dead letters, spend (7 days)
select * from source_alerts;     -- sources that failed or found nothing in each of their last 3 runs
select * from review_queue where status = 'pending' order by created_at desc;
```

`npm run pipeline -- health` prints the same. A run's `status`: `succeeded`, `partial` (some items failed), `blocked`
(source stopped: 403, CAPTCHA, rate limit or treg 402), `failed` (nothing worked). The runner also logs
`ALERT: source ... last 3 runs` lines. Spend: `var/spend-ledger.jsonl` (gitignored) and `paid_calls`.

For `pipeline run`, the CLI exits **0** when every executed stage succeeds and **1** if any stage is
`partial`, `failed`, or `blocked`. Later stages still run, and the JSON report includes an overall
`status` (`succeeded` or `failed`) plus each stage's `blocked` reason and `errors`. Standard error
also lists unsuccessful stages, so GitHub Actions marks the command as failed. Every executed
stage participates in this result; disabled sources do not run. Clean empty results, candidates
awaiting review, and ordinary contact-budget skips remain successful. Logged source alerts alone
do not change the exit code. This does not enable any schedules.

## 5. Add a source

1. Add a row to `sources` (migration) with `type`, `frequency`, `max_requests_per_run`, `min_delay_ms`, `enabled`.
2. Implement `Collector` in `src/pipeline/collectors/` returning `RawItem`s exactly as received (put reading context in `meta.kind`).
   Use `PoliteHttp` for HTTP, or `paidTregCall` for treg (budget check + ledger + 402 handling).
3. Register it in `collectors` (`src/pipeline/collectors/sources.ts`) and add a reader for its `meta.kind` in `extractCapture`.
4. Record real responses into `tests/fixtures/ingestion/` (scrub secrets) and add contract tests: happy, empty,
   unavailable, CAPTCHA, 429, 403, malformed, timeout.
Stefan's raw-JSON input work plugs in here: a collector that returns his JSON as `RawItem`s needs no other changes.

## 6. Switch the model

`PIPELINE_LLM=ollama OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b`, or a paid provider after approval:
`PIPELINE_LLM=openai PIPELINE_ALLOW_PAID_LLM=1 PIPELINE_LLM_BUDGET_USD=0.50 OPENAI_API_KEY=...`.
The prompt is versioned (`src/pipeline/prompts/extract-vN.md`, `PIPELINE_PROMPT_VERSION`). Compare on the golden set first:
`npm run pipeline:eval -- --model <model> --runs 5 --prompt extract-vN`. Another provider only needs a class implementing
`LLMProvider` (`src/pipeline/types.ts`).

## 7. Enable the schedule (after approval only)

The workflows in `.github/workflows/ingestion-{daily,weekly,rescore,import}.yml` ship with `workflow_dispatch` only.
To turn on a schedule: uncomment its `schedule:` block, set repository secrets `PIPELINE_SUPABASE_URL`,
`PIPELINE_SUPABASE_KEY`, `TREG_TOKEN` and variables `PIPELINE_ALLOW_REMOTE`, `PIPELINE_CONTACT`, `TREG_BUDGET_USD`
(default 0 = no paid calls), `PIPELINE_LLM` (hosted runners have no Ollama; default `none` = structured signals only).
Apply `supabase/migrations/202610190001_ingestion_pipeline.sql` to the target first (after a backup).
**Budget in CI is per run:** the spend ledger is a local file and GitHub runners start empty, so `TREG_BUDGET_USD` caps
each workflow run, not each day. With a daily schedule, the daily treg ceiling is `TREG_BUDGET_USD` × runs per day.
Paid email lookups are still never repeated (`paid_calls` in the database).
The Monday `weekly-snapshot.yml` is unchanged and still runs.

## 8. Verified Workday endpoint facts (2026-10-13)

- `POST https://{tenant}.{pod}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}/jobs` with `{appliedFacets:{}, limit, offset, searchText}`.
  `limit` max 20 (21 -> HTTP 400). `total` is capped at 2000; offsets ≥ 2000 return the same page again. Wrong site -> HTTP 422.
  `searchText` is fuzzy (Target's "Analyst Payroll FinOps" matched "Workday" without containing it).
- `GET .../wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}{externalPath}` -> `jobPostingInfo` (HTML `jobDescription`, `startDate`, `externalUrl`, `jobReqId`).
- `https://{tenant}.{pod}.myworkdayjobs.com/robots.txt` lists every site as `Sitemap: .../{site}/siteMap.xml` and allows `/wday/`.
  Unknown tenant -> HTTP 422; some private tenants -> 401.
- Name-to-tenant guessing finds about 1 in 4 public-company names (3 of 12 in a probe); abbreviations (WM, MMC) are missed.
